            <h2>WHAT TO DISCOVER?</h2>
            <p>
                To say Palawan is a beach bum's fantasy is an understatement. Sailing the length of the province­ from the north to the southern tip of the main island-brings you up close and personal with paradise in countless forms: from the coral-fringed dreamscapes of the Calamianes and the karst limestone formations of El Nido, to the wind-swept shorelines of central Palawan and the pristine sandbars of Balabac.
                </p>
                <p>Quite simply, Palawan has the best beaches-not only in the Philippines, but in all of southeast Asia. The best part? Only a fraction of them are known.</p> 
                
                <p>Palawan has always had an environmental streak. It was one of the first provinces to crack down on litter, noise pollution, and single-use plastics. A lot is at stake, as the province's booming tourism industry relies on the successful preservation of its pristine ecology and natural beauty. Against this backdrop, several award­ winning resorts are leading the way toward a more sustainable future, blending native design and low­ carbon elements like solar panels, composting, and edible gardens to create living spaces that will last.</p>

            <h2>The Crown Jewel</h2>
        <p>El Nido is one of the beautiful places in the world, in my opinion. Islands that are incredibly unique that you can distinguish them from one another.<br>
        Overall, El Nido is the perfect place for a vacation, bars, parties and specially the landmarks for your sightseing satifaction. </p> 
    <p>Palawan is the crown jewel of the Philippines and El Nido is arguably the most impressive spot in Palawan. With it’s dramatic, enormous limestone cliffs, unbelievable lagoons, and pristine beaches it truly is paradise on earth. What makes El Nido even more appealing is that it can be done on a very tight budget for a backpacker or you can enjoy luxury hotels. Either way, the island-hopping tours, the key feature of an El Nido experience, are $15-$20 per day no matter what your budget is. The town itself of El Nido has a simple charm with reggae bars, beach restaurants, and a low-key atmosphere.
